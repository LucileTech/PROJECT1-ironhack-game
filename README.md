Project #1 game Ironhack

# Cat Game made by Lucile Tronczyk

## Why I choose this game?

It seemed to have a lot of things going on : DOM, array manipulations, training on classes and methods... But also a good look for the animation part.

## Key features

- CANVAS
- Hit collision 1: Whive the monsters
- Hit collision 2: Whive the bugs
- Animation and trajectories of characters

## What's next?

- Level 2 with other monsters and other bugs colors
- Clean my code and structure it with different JS files.
- Do a better FRONT
