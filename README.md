Project #1 game Ironhack

# Cat Game made by Lucile Tronczyk

This is my first ever Javascript project.

## Why I choose this game?

It seemed to have a lot of things going on in order to practice : DOM, array manipulations, training on classes and methods... But also a good look for the animation part.

## Key features

- Canvas
- Animation and trajectories of characters
- Hit collision 1: Whith the monsters
- Hit collision 2: Whith the bugs
- Level 2

## What's next?

- Animations movements from level 2
- Do a nicer FRONT
- Clean my code and structure it with different JS files.
