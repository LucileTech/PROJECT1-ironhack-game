# PROJECT1-ironhack-game

This is my first ever Javascript project !
Made in 1 week in October 2022 during Web Dev Bootcamp Ironhack.

# Cat Game made by Lucile Tronczyk

## Why I choose this game?

It seemed to have a lot of things going on in order to practice : DOM, array manipulations, training on classes and methods... But also a good look for the animation part through canvas.

## Key features

- Canvas
- Animation and trajectories of characters
- Hit collision 1: Whith the monsters
- Hit collision 2: Whith the bugs
- Level 2

## What's next?

- More animations movements (cat, bugs and enemies)
- Life counter
- Nicer FRONT (I did not have time to improve it during the only week we had to build this project)
- Clean my code and structure it with different JS files.
